You don't have to connect to 'darkweb' to buy; you can do it from any server (once the TOR router has been purchased). 
To nuke a server, you just need the minimum ports open. You don't need to have your hack level up to the servers. 
You can run scripts on any server that you can nuke. 
Put the above two together - you can use nuked servers (even if above your hack level) to run scripts and help hack other servers.

Fourth: make it run correctly. Finally: optimize it. 

******* Hacknet Servers *******
Hacknet servers (not to be confused with Hacknet nodes) allow you to reduce the minimum security levels of servers and increase 
the servers' maximum money amount (among other things). It's a huge waste to use Hacknet servers for running hacking scripts when 
you could be using them to make the other servers you're hacking produce more money faster or the like.

I mostly use my Hacknet servers to bring other servers down to a minimum security level of 1 (though you don't need to go all the 
way down to the minimum) and up to a maximum money of as much as $10.2 trillion. Thus, at two batch attacks per second, those 
fully-modified servers are netting me about $20 trillion per second each. At a hacking level of around 1000, each batch attack against 
those servers uses about 12TB +/- 2 RAM, and only about 45 +/- 5 batches need to run at the same time for two attacks per second. I 
spend just enough money to increase the RAM and cores on the "home" server so that I can launch all of those attacks (4 - 16PB is plenty 
of RAM for that).

As for leveling up your Hacknet servers, increasing their levels, RAM, and cores all increase the speed of your Hacknet servers. The 
trick is knowing when to purchase which one of those three improvements. What you should do is write some code which will calculate 
for you the highest hash rate per dollar amount spent you'd get for levels, RAM, and cores, and then just buy that one.

Once you do that, you'll then discover, for example, you should buy approximately 4.25 levels per core. This allows you to maximize the 
rate at which hash production goes up, which increases the speed at which you can upgrade the servers you're attacking, which increases 
the speed a which you can make money from them to level up your Hacknet servers more.

Buying cache for your Hacknet servers is only needed when you can't store enough hashes to buy the next upgrade, at which time you should 
just buy the cheapest cache upgrade available among your Hashnet servers.
