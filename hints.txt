You don't have to connect to 'darkweb' to buy; you can do it from any server (once the TOR router has been purchased). 
To nuke a server, you just need the minimum ports open. You don't need to have your hack level up to the servers. 
You can run scripts on any server that you can nuke. 
Put the above two together - you can use nuked servers (even if above your hack level) to run scripts and help hack other servers.
