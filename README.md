# My Bitburner Scripts
A collection of Netscript (Javascript based) scripts and general information for the game Bitburner (https://bitburner-official.github.io/). 
Some of these scripts may contain copies or (more likley) adaptaions of JS code I have found. 

# Spoilers!
Some scripts / files may contain spoilers for the game. At some point, I would like to section these out and put them into a different directory, but that is not the case yet. 

# About me:
I am a C/C++ developer by trade, with experience with Python and Lua in my recent employment. While I have learned some JS for this game, I do not consider myself a JS developer. This is evident in the code; I will often bypass the one-line built-in JS conventions to do the same thing in a multi-line loop. 

# Everthing is political these days... 
If you agree with Fascism, or with those leaders who embrace it (e.g. the convicted felon, know rapists, and pedophile, Donald Trump) - respectfully, go deepthroat a cactus. I can't stop you from using my code, but it comes with a curse for fascists and fascist-enablers: I curse you with extra knowledge and empathy. I curse you to know and understand the pain you have unknowingly inflicted on others.
