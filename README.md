# My Bitburner Scripts
A collection of Netscript (Javascript based) scripts and general information for the game Bitburner (https://bitburner-official.github.io/). 
Some of these scripts may contain copies or (more likley) adaptaions of JS code I have found. 

# About me:
I am a C/C++ developer by trade, with experience with Python and Lua in my recent employment. While I have learned some JS for this game, I do not consider myself a JS developer. This is evident in the code; I will often bypass the one-line built-in JS conventions to do the same thing is a multi-line loop.
